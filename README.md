# California Housing Predictor
This Machine Learning project takes data from the StatLib repository on California Housing Prices and aims to create an accurate housing price predictive model. Firstly, Exploratory Data Analysis and feature engineering are performed. Next I develop a robust pipeline for feature handling and model creation. Finally, I perform extensive model selection, cross validation and tuning to extract the most optimal price predictior, saving it for future use.

Additionally I provide a .ipynb cell that loads all necessary functions and packages for using the model later wihtout having to rerun all of the main pipeline.

## ML Project Checklist / Overview
1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture
2. Get the data
3. Explore the data to gain insights
4. Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to machine learning algorithms
5. Explore many different models and shortlist the best ones
6. Fine-tune your models and combine them into a great solution
7. Present your solution
8. Launch, monitor and maintain your system
